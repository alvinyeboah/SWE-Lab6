## Project Description
This project is a collaborative effort to create a simple static website consisting of four pages:
1. A landing page (index.html)
2. Individual profile pages for each team member

The project serves as a practical exercise in Git and GitHub workflows, including:
- Repository initialization
- Branch management
- Merging changes using pull requests
- Writing meaningful commit messages

## Development Workflow
We are following the feature-branch workflow:
1. Each team member works on their profile page in a separate feature branch
2. Changes are committed with descriptive messages
3. Pull requests are created for code review
4. Approved changes are merged into the main branch

## Submission
The final deliverable will be submitted via CANVAS, including:
- GitHub Repository link
- Completed website with all pages
